                This is a dungeon level that I created for my <a href="https://coursefinder.illinoisstate.edu/ctk/352/" target="_blank">Game Design II</a> class. The assignment was to create and design a level for a game and then play that level in front of the class. I chose to build my level using the program <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622800/Super_Dungeon_Maker/" target="_blank">Super Dungeon Maker</a> and this was the result. The level consists of two floors, a main floor, and then a basement. The goal of this level is to navigate the varies rooms in this dungeon to uncover tools and weapons to help reach the end room containing the golden egg. Throughout the level the players need to fight enemies and collect resources that will allow them to get to the next room. I had a lot of fun making this level as I got to really explore my creative ideas and see them flow onto the screen.

                <a href="https://coursefinder.illinoisstate.edu/ctk/351/" target="_blank">Game Design I</a> - This is a photo of fellow game designers playtesting one of the games I co-designed. The point of this assignment was high mechanics and high story. This means that the game had to have a lot of features but also be explained in a story. The game had four different characters and four different biomes which we had to explain. This game took a lot of thinking and planning as the characters' attributes had to correlate with where they came from. This was personally one of my favorite games I designed as it incorporated a lot of the ideas I came up with and the people who play-tested it also really enjoyed it.
